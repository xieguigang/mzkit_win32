## About
Using a Hamamatsu slide scanner such as the NanoZoomer, you may end up with NDPI files that can't always be directly open in standard image analysis software such as ImageJ. NDPITools is a collection of software that can convert NDPI files to standard TIFF files, possibly cutting them into smaller JPEG or TIFF pieces that will better fit into your computer's memory. It comes with a bundle of plugins for ImageJ which enable the use of the software directly inside ImageJ with point-and-click.

## Download
The software is open source, distributed under the GNU General Public License v. 3.0 or any later version, at your option. It is based on the libtiff, libjpeg , and libjpeg-turbo software, made free and open by its authors, which we acknowledge.

You can get the software through download (see the links in the frame). We provide some pre-compiled versions. The 32-bit Windows version should run under all versions of Windows (XP, Vista, 7; either 32- or 64-bits) but will produce images which require at most ca. 1 GiB memory. The 64-bit version goes beyond that limit.
